how to fix the following bug:

 Keras MaxPooling2D gives ValueError: Negative dimension size caused by subtracting 2 from 1 for 'MaxPool_x'

https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/3945

In fact, this problem results from your initial input.
input_shape=(3,224,224) is for "theano"
and your backend should be "tensorflow", so it should be
input_shape=(224,224,3).
