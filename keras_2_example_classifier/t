Hey Yen,

I am the founder of Data Record Science. I believe in-depth and correct product data will provide immediate bottom-line benefits to Ebates and Rakuten - and DRS is the one company that has this technology. Ebates/Rakuten have the scale, and business model, to make the best use of our product database. 

DRS has product matching technology. A canonical matched product record, including variants, with canonical values and a list of stores/store product info is generated for each product. Bad/missing data is detected.
